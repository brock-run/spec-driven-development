## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Gradual Replacement
**Best for:** Teams with existing documentation processes
**Approach:**
- Replace existing documentation with SDD specs
- Maintain current development workflow initially
- Gradually introduce AI-assisted implementation
- Measure improvement in quality and velocity

### Pattern 2: Agile Integration
**Best for:** Scrum/Kanban teams
**Approach:**
- Use SDD for sprint planning and story refinement
- Replace user story templates with spec templates
- Integrate AI agents into development workflow
- Maintain sprint cadence and ceremonies

### Pattern 3: Quality-First Implementation
**Best for:** Teams with technical debt or quality issues
**Approach:**
- Start with critical bug fixes and new features
- Use SDD to improve requirement clarity
- Focus on testing and validation improvements
- Gradually expand to maintenance work

### Pattern 4: Architecture-Driven Integration
**Best for:** Complex systems with multiple components
**Approach:**
- Map SDD to existing architecture patterns
- Create service-specific or component-specific specs
- Maintain architectural boundaries in spec organization
- Use SDD for cross-service integration planning

## Legacy System Considerations

### Monolithic Applications
```mermaid

    A[Monolithic App] --> B[Identify Modules]
    B --> C[Module-Level Specs]
    C --> D[Interface Documentation]
    D --> E[Gradual Refactoring]
    E --> F[Service Extraction]
```

**Challenges:**
- Tight coupling between components
- Shared databases and state
- Large, complex codebases
- Resistance to change

**SDD Strategies:**
- Focus on new feature development
- Create specs for major modules or subsystems
- Use SDD for API design and documentation
- Plan refactoring with architectural specs

### Microservices Architecture
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Microservices] --> B[Service Boundaries]
    B --> C[Independent Specs]
    C --> D[API Contracts]
    D --> E[Integration Testing]
    E --> F[Service Evolution]
```

**Advantages:**
- Natural boundaries for spec organization
- Independent development and deployment
- Clear API contracts and interfaces
- Easier to adopt SDD incrementally

**SDD Strategies:**
- One spec per service or bounded context
- Focus on API-first development
- Use SDD for service integration planning
- Coordinate cross-service features with umbrella specs

### Hybrid Architectures
```mermaid

    A[Hybrid System] --> B[Legacy Core]
    A --> C[Modern Services]
    A --> D[Integration Layer]
    
    B --> E[Maintenance Specs]
    C --> F[Full SDD Workflow]
    D --> G[Integration Specs]
```

**Complexity Factors:**
- Multiple technology stacks
- Different development practices per component
- Complex integration requirements
- Varying team expertise levels

**SDD Strategies:**
- Tailor approach to each component type
- Focus on integration points and APIs
- Use SDD for modernization planning
- Create migration roadmaps with specs

## Workflow Integration Strategies

### Sprint Planning Integration
1. **Story Refinement**: Use spec templates for complex stories
2. **Acceptance Criteria**: Replace traditional AC with EARS format
3. **Technical Planning**: Create plan.md for architectural decisions
4. **Task Breakdown**: Use SDD task templates for implementation

### Code Review Integration
1. **Spec Review**: Review specs before implementation
2. **Implementation Validation**: Verify code matches spec requirements
3. **Documentation Updates**: Keep specs synchronized with code changes
4. **Quality Gates**: Use SDD checklists in review process

### CI/CD Integration
1. **Spec Validation**: Automated checking of spec completeness
2. **Requirement Traceability**: Link commits to spec requirements
3. **Documentation Generation**: Auto-generate docs from specs
4. **Quality Metrics**: Track spec coverage and implementation alignment

## Change Management Strategies

### Organizational Readiness Assessment
