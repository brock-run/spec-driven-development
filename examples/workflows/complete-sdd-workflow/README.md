# Complete SDD Workflow Example

## Overview

This example demonstrates a complete Spec-Driven Development workflow from initial idea to implementation, showing how requirements evolve through the specification, planning, and task breakdown phases.

## Project: User Authentication System

### Initial Idea
"We need a secure login system for our web application that supports multiple authentication methods and integrates with our existing user database."

### SDD Workflow Progression

#### 1. Requirements Gathering (spec.md)
- Started with high-level business needs
- Refined into specific functional and technical requirements
- Added security and compliance considerations
- Defined success criteria and acceptance tests

#### 2. Technical Planning (plan.md)
- Analyzed requirements and made architectural decisions
- Chose technology stack and integration approach
- Designed security architecture and data models
- Planned testing and deployment strategies

#### 3. Implementation Tasks (tasks.md)
- Broke down plan into specific coding tasks
- Ensured each task references specific requirements
- Organized tasks for incremental development
- Added testing and validation steps

### Key Workflow Insights

1. **Iterative Refinement**: Requirements became more specific through the planning process
2. **Requirement Traceability**: Every implementation task traces back to specific requirements
3. **Risk Management**: Technical constraints identified early influenced design decisions
4. **AI-Friendly Structure**: Clear, structured specifications enable effective AI assistance

### Workflow Timeline

- **Week 1**: Requirements gathering and stakeholder alignment
- **Week 2**: Technical planning and architecture design
- **Week 3**: Task breakdown and implementation planning
- **Weeks 4-8**: Implementation following the task plan
- **Week 9**: Testing, deployment, and validation

### Lessons Learned

1. **Front-loaded Planning**: Time invested in specification pays dividends during implementation
2. **Clear Requirements**: Specific, testable requirements prevent scope creep and rework
3. **Incremental Development**: Task breakdown enables continuous progress and early validation
4. **AI Collaboration**: Well-structured specs enable effective AI pair programming

This example serves as a template for teams adopting SDD methodology, showing how disciplined specification leads to more predictable and successful development outcomes.
