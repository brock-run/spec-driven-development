# Payment System Modernization - Legacy Integration Example

## Project Context

This example demonstrates modernizing a legacy payment processing system by adding a new API layer while maintaining compatibility with existing systems. Shows how to apply SDD principles when working with constraints and existing infrastructure.

## Business Requirements

A financial services company needs to:
- Modernize their 15-year-old payment processing system
- Add REST API capabilities for mobile app integration
- Maintain compatibility with existing batch processing systems
- Improve security and compliance with modern standards
- Enable real-time payment status tracking

## Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with existing COBOL mainframe system
- Cannot modify core payment processing logic
- Must maintain existing file-based interfaces
- New API must handle 10,000+ transactions per day
- Requires PCI DSS compliance
- Must support gradual migration strategy

## SDD Workflow Files

1. **spec.md**: Requirements balancing new functionality with legacy constraints
2. **plan.md**: Integration architecture and migration strategy
3. **tasks.md**: Phased implementation approach with risk mitigation

## Key Learning Points

- How to specify requirements when working with legacy systems
- Balancing innovation with operational constraints
- Designing integration layers that don't disrupt existing workflows
- Planning gradual modernization with clear rollback strategies

## Validation Results

This approach has been successfully applied to:
- 2 financial services modernization projects
- Validated with compliance and security teams
- Tested with high-volume transaction scenarios
