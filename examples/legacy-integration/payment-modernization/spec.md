### Monitoring and Logging
- **TR-6.1**: System SHALL provide real-time monitoring dashboards
- **TR-6.2**: All transactions SHALL be logged with correlation IDs
- **TR-6.3**: System SHALL alert on mainframe integration failures
- **TR-6.4**: Performance metrics SHALL be collected and analyzed

## Legacy System Constraints

### Mainframe Integration Points
- **File Drop Location**: `/mainframe/input/` for payment requests
- **Response Location**: `/mainframe/output/` for payment confirmations
- **File Format**: Fixed-width text files with specific record layouts
- **Processing Schedule**: Batch processing every 15 minutes during business hours

### Existing Data Formats
```
Payment Request Record (200 characters):
Positions 1-10:   Transaction ID
Positions 11-20:  Account Number
Positions 21-30:  Amount (with 2 decimal places)
Positions 31-40:  Payment Type Code
Positions 41-140: Payee Information
Positions 141-200: Reserved for future use
```

### Business Rules (Cannot be Modified)
- Maximum daily payment limit: $50,000 per account
- ACH payments require 1 business day processing
- Wire transfers processed same day if submitted before 2 PM EST
- International payments require additional compliance checks

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/token` - OAuth 2.0 token generation
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh

### Payments
- `POST /payments` - Initiate new payment
- `GET /payments/{id}` - Get payment status
- `GET /payments` - List payments with filtering
- `PUT /payments/{id}/cancel` - Cancel pending payment

### Accounts
- `GET /accounts/{id}/balance` - Get account balance
- `GET /accounts/{id}/payments` - Get account payment history
- `GET /accounts/{id}/limits` - Get account payment limits

### Reports
- `GET /reports/transactions` - Transaction reports for compliance
- `GET /reports/audit` - Audit trail reports

## Data Models

### Payment Request
```typescript
interface PaymentRequest {
  id: string;
  accountId: string;
  amount: number;
  paymentType: 'ACH' | 'WIRE' | 'CHECK';
  payeeInfo: {
    name: string;
    accountNumber: string;
    routingNumber: string;
    address: Address;
  };
  description: string;
  requestedDate: Date;
  status: 'PENDING' | 'PROCESSING' | 'COMPLETED' | 'FAILED' | 'CANCELLED';
}
```

### Payment Response
```typescript
interface PaymentResponse {
  id: string;
  status: PaymentStatus;
  confirmationNumber?: string;
  processedDate?: Date;
  errorCode?: string;
  errorMessage?: string;
  mainframeReference?: string;
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: API Layer Development (Weeks 1-4)
- Build REST API with basic payment operations
- Implement file-based mainframe integration
- Create monitoring and logging infrastructure

### Phase 2: Security and Compliance (Weeks 5-6)
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Add encryption and PCI DSS compliance features
- Complete security audit and penetration testing

### Phase 3: Production Deployment (Weeks 7-8)
- Deploy to production with limited user base
- Monitor integration with mainframe systems
- Gradual rollout to all users

### Phase 4: Optimization (Weeks 9-12)
- Performance tuning based on production metrics
- Additional features based on user feedback
- Documentation and training for support teams

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Mainframe Integration Failure**: Implement robust error handling and retry logic
- **Performance Issues**: Load testing with production-like data volumes
- **Data Consistency**: Implement reconciliation processes between systems

### Business Risks
- **Compliance Violations**: Regular security audits and compliance reviews
- **Service Disruption**: Gradual rollout with immediate rollback capability
- **User Adoption**: Comprehensive training and support documentation

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional**: All payment types processed successfully through API
2. **Performance**: API meets response time requirements under load
3. **Integration**: Seamless operation with existing mainframe systems
4. **Security**: Passes PCI DSS compliance audit
5. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime during business hours
6. **User Adoption**: 80% of eligible transactions processed via new API within 6 months
