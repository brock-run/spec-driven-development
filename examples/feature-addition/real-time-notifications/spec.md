## Integration Points

### Existing Order System Events
```typescript
// Events to consume from existing system
interface OrderEvent {
  eventType: 'ORDER_CREATED' | 'ORDER_CONFIRMED' | 'ORDER_SHIPPED' | 'ORDER_DELIVERED' | 'PAYMENT_PROCESSED';
  orderId: string;
  customerId: string;
  merchantId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  data: OrderEventData;
}
```

### User Management Integration
```typescript
// Existing user service interface
interface UserService {
  getUserById(id: string): Promise<User>;
  getUserPreferences(id: string): Promise<NotificationPreferences>;
  updateUserPreferences(id: string, prefs: NotificationPreferences): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Existing API Constraints
- Must not modify existing order processing endpoints
- Cannot add more than 50ms to existing API response times
- Must use existing authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Cannot change existing database schema for orders or users

## New API Endpoints

### Notification Management
- `GET /notifications` - Get user's notification history
- `PUT /notifications/{id}/read` - Mark notification as read
- `DELETE /notifications/{id}` - Delete notification

### Preference Management
- `GET /users/{id}/notification-preferences` - Get user notification settings
- `PUT /users/{id}/notification-preferences` - Update notification preferences
- `POST /users/{id}/notification-preferences/test` - Send test notification

### Admin and Analytics
- `GET /admin/notifications/stats` - Notification delivery statistics
- `GET /admin/notifications/failed` - Failed notification reports
- `POST /admin/notifications/broadcast` - Send broadcast notifications

## Data Models

### Notification
```typescript
interface Notification {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  type: NotificationType;
  title: string;
  message: string;
  data?: Record<string, any>;
  channels: NotificationChannel[];
  status: 'PENDING' | 'SENT' | 'DELIVERED' | 'FAILED' | 'READ';
  createdAt: Date;
  sentAt?: Date;
  readAt?: Date;
}
```

### Notification Preferences
```typescript
interface NotificationPreferences {
  userId: string;
  channels: {
    push: boolean;
    email: boolean;
    sms: boolean;
    inApp: boolean;
  };
  types: {
    orderUpdates: boolean;
    paymentConfirmations: boolean;
    promotions: boolean;
    systemAlerts: boolean;
  };
  quietHours: {
    enabled: boolean;
    startTime: string; // HH:mm format
    endTime: string;
    timezone: string;
  };
}
```

### Notification Template
```typescript
interface NotificationTemplate {
  id: string;
  type: NotificationType;
  channel: NotificationChannel;
  subject?: string; // for email
  title: string;
  body: string;
  variables: string[]; // template variables
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

## Event Processing Architecture

### Event Flow
```
Existing Order System → Event Bus → Notification Service → Notification Providers → Users
                                         ↓
                                   Preference Check → Template Engine → Delivery Queue
```

### Event Bus Integration
- Use existing Redis pub/sub or message queue system
- Subscribe to order-related events without modifying publishers
- Implement dead letter queue for failed event processing
- Maintain event ordering for related notifications

## Notification Providers

### Push Notifications
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for Android devices
- **Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)** for iOS devices
- **Web Push API** for browser notifications

### Email Notifications
- **SendGrid** for transactional emails
- **Amazon SES** as backup provider
- HTML email templates with responsive design

### SMS Notifications
- **Twilio** for SMS delivery
- **AWS SNS** as backup provider
- Support for international phone numbers

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
- Set up notification service with basic event processing
- Implement database schema for notifications and preferences
- Create basic notification templates

### Phase 2: Channel Integration (Weeks 3-4)
- Integrate with push notification providers (FCM, APNS)
- Implement email notification system with templates
- Add SMS notification capability

### Phase 3: User Experience (Weeks 5-6)
- Build notification preference management UI
- Implement in-app notification center
- Add notification history and read status

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-8)
- Implement quiet hours and advanced preferences
- Add notification analytics and reporting
- Performance optimization and monitoring

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Testing
- Test event consumption from existing order system
- Verify notification delivery through all channels
- Test preference management and filtering logic
- Validate performance impact on existing systems

### Load Testing
- Simulate high-volume notification scenarios
- Test concurrent WebSocket connections
- Verify system behavior under notification spikes
- Test provider failover and retry mechanisms

### User Acceptance Testing
- Test notification delivery across different devices
- Verify preference settings work correctly
- Test notification timing and content accuracy
- Validate user experience flows

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics
- Notification delivery rates by channel
- Average delivery time from trigger to receipt
- User engagement rates (open, click, read)
- System performance impact on existing services

### Alerting
- Failed notification delivery above threshold
- Provider API failures or rate limiting
- High notification processing latency
- Database connection or performance issues

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Provider Outages**: Implement multiple providers with automatic failover
- **Performance Impact**: Thorough load testing and performance monitoring
- **Event Loss**: Implement event persistence and replay capabilities

### Business Risks
- **Spam Complaints**: Strict preference management and opt-out mechanisms
- **User Fatigue**: Smart notification frequency management
- **Compliance**: GDPR and CAN-SPAM compliance for email notifications

## Success Criteria

1. **Delivery Performance**: 95% of notifications delivered within 5 seconds
2. **System Stability**: No impact on existing order processing performance
3. **User Engagement**: 70% notification open rate for critical updates
4. **Reliability**: 99.9% notification service uptime
5. **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on notification relevance and timing
