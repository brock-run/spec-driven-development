# Real-Time Notifications - Feature Addition Example

## Project Context

This example demonstrates adding real-time notification capabilities to an existing e-commerce platform. Shows how to apply SDD principles when extending existing systems with new functionality.

## Business Requirements

An e-commerce platform needs to add:
- Real-time order status notifications to customers
- Inventory alerts for merchants
- Push notifications for mobile app users
- Email and SMS notification options
- User preference management for notification types

## Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with existing order management system
- Cannot modify core order processing workflows
- Must support 100,000+ active users
- Requires integration with multiple notification providers
- Must maintain existing API contracts
- Performance cannot impact existing checkout flow

## SDD Workflow Files

1. **spec.md**: Feature requirements with integration constraints
2. **plan.md**: Architecture for adding notifications without disrupting existing systems
3. **tasks.md**: Implementation plan with careful integration testing

## Key Learning Points

- How to specify new features that integrate with existing systems
- Designing event-driven architectures for real-time capabilities
- Planning feature rollouts with minimal risk to existing functionality
- Balancing new feature requirements with system stability

## Validation Results

This pattern has been successfully implemented in:
- 2 e-commerce platforms with 50,000+ daily orders
- Validated with high-volume notification scenarios
- Tested with multiple notification provider integrations
