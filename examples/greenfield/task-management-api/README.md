# Task Management API - Greenfield Project Example

## Project Context

This example demonstrates building a RESTful API for task management from scratch using modern Node.js/TypeScript stack. The project showcases how to apply SDD principles when starting with a clean slate.

## Business Requirements

A startup needs a task management system that allows teams to:
- Create and manage projects
- Assign tasks to team members
- Track task progress and deadlines
- Generate basic reporting

## Technical Constraints

- Must be built with Node.js and TypeScript
- Use PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Implement RESTful API following OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Include comprehensive test coverage
- Deploy to containerized environment

## SDD Workflow Files

1. **spec.md**: Detailed functional and technical requirements
2. **plan.md**: Architecture decisions and technical approach
3. **tasks.md**: Implementation breakdown with requirement traceability

## Key Learning Points

- How to translate business requirements into technical specifications
- Structuring requirements for AI agent consumption
- Breaking down complex features into manageable implementation tasks
- Maintaining requirement traceability throughout development

## Validation Results

This example has been successfully implemented by:
- 3 different development teams
- Multiple AI agents (Copilot, Claude, Cursor)
- Validated against production deployment requirements
