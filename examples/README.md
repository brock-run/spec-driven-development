# Example Specifications and Workflows

This directory contains real-world examples of Spec-Driven Development workflows, demonstrating how to apply SDD principles across different project types and scenarios.

## Directory Structure

- **greenfield/**: Examples for new projects starting from scratch
- **legacy-integration/**: Examples for modernizing existing systems
- **feature-addition/**: Examples for adding features to existing codebases
- **workflows/**: Complete end-to-end workflow examples from spec to implementation

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Study the Structure**: Each example follows the standard SDD pattern (spec.md → plan.md → tasks.md)
2. **Understand the Context**: Read the project background and constraints
3. **Follow the Workflow**: See how requirements translate to design and implementation tasks
4. **Adapt for Your Needs**: Use these as templates for similar scenarios in your projects

## Example Categories

### Project Types
- **Greenfield Projects**: Starting fresh with modern architecture
- **Legacy Integration**: Working with existing systems and constraints
- **Feature Addition**: Extending existing functionality

### Complexity Levels
- **Simple**: Single-component features with clear boundaries
- **Moderate**: Multi-component features with some integration complexity
- **Complex**: System-wide changes requiring architectural decisions

### Domain Examples
- **Web Applications**: Frontend and backend development
- **API Development**: RESTful and GraphQL services
- **Mobile Applications**: Cross-platform and native development
- **Data Processing**: ETL pipelines and analytics systems
