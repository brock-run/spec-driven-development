# Tutorial 1: Your First Complete SDD Workflow

## Overview

This tutorial guides you through a **complete workflow** of Spec-Driven Development, from initial requirements gathering to final implementation **validation**. You'll build a user authentication feature using real SDD practices and tools with **step by step** guidance.

**Duration**: 4 hours
**Prerequisites**: Completion of Fundamentals Track
**Tools Needed**: GitHub account, AI agent access (Copilot, Claude, or similar), text editor

## Learning Objectives

By completing this tutorial, you will:
- Execute a complete SDD workflow from start to finish
- Practice requirements gathering and specification writing
- Use AI agents effectively for implementation
- Apply quality assurance throughout the development process
- Understand common challenges and how to overcome them

## Scenario: User Authentication System

You're tasked with adding user authentication to a web application. The product team has provided basic requirements, but you need to create detailed specifications and implement the feature using SDD methodology.

### Initial Requirements (from Product Team)
- Users should be able to register for accounts
- Users should be able to log in and log out
- Passwords should be secure
- The system should remember logged-in users
- Invalid login attempts should be handled gracefully

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering (45 minutes)

### Step 1: Stakeholder Interview Simulation (15 minutes)

Let's expand the basic requirements through systematic questioning. For this tutorial, we'll simulate stakeholder responses:

#### Security Requirements
**Q: What are the password requirements?**
**A:** Minimum 8 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character.

**Q: How should we handle failed login attempts?**
**A:** Lock account after 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes. Send email notification.

**Q: What authentication method should we use?**
**A:** Email and password. No social login for now, but design should allow future expansion.

#### User Experience Requirements
**Q: How long should users stay logged in?**
**A:** 30 days with "Remember Me" option, otherwise 24 hours.

**Q: What happens when a session expires?**
**A:** Redirect to login page with message explaining session expiration.

**Q: Should we have email verification for new accounts?**
**A:** Yes, users must verify email before they can log in.

### Step 2: User Story Creation (15 minutes)

Transform the requirements into structured user stories:

```markdown
## User Stories

### US-1: User Registration
**As a** new user
**I want to** create an account with email and password
**So that** I can access the application's features

### US-2: Email Verification
**As a** registered user
**I want to** verify my email address
**So that** I can activate my account and log in

### US-3: User Login
**As a** registered user
**I want to** log in with my email and password
**So that** I can access my account and use the application

### US-4: Session Management
**As a** logged-in user
**I want** my session to persist appropriately
**So that** I don't have to log in repeatedly while maintaining security

### US-5: Account Security
**As a** user
**I want** my account to be protected from unauthorized access
**So that** my personal information remains secure

### US-6: Password Recovery
**As a** user who forgot their password
**I want to** reset my password securely
**So that** I can regain access to my account
```

### Step 3: Acceptance Criteria Definition (15 minutes)

For each user story, define specific, testable acceptance criteria using EARS format:

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid email and password THEN the system SHALL create a new account
2. WHEN a user provides an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL display "Email already registered" error
3. WHEN a user provides invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display "Invalid email format" error
4. WHEN a user provides password not meeting requirements THEN the system SHALL display specific password requirement errors
5. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL send verification email and display "Check your email" message

### US-2: Email Verification
1. WHEN a user clicks valid verification link THEN the system SHALL activate the account
2. WHEN a user clicks expired verification link THEN the system SHALL display error and offer to resend
3. WHEN a user tries to log in with unverified account THEN the system SHALL display "Please verify your email" message
4. IF verification link is invalid THEN the system SHALL display "Invalid verification link" error

### US-3: User Login
1. WHEN a user provides correct email and password THEN the system SHALL log them in and redirect to dashboard

4. WHEN a user selects "Remember Me" THEN the system SHALL extend session to 30 days
5. IF user account is not verified THEN the system SHALL display verification reminder with resend option

### US-4: Session Management
1. WHEN a user session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with "Session expired" message
2. WHEN a user closes browser without "Remember Me" THEN the system SHALL require login on return
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate session and redirect to login page
4. IF user is inactive for session timeout period THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out

### US-5: Account Security
1. WHEN a user fails login 5 times within 15 minutes THEN the system SHALL lock the account
2. WHEN an account is locked THEN the system SHALL send email notification to account owner
3. WHEN account lockout period expires THEN the system SHALL automatically unlock the account
4. IF suspicious login activity is detected THEN the system SHALL require additional verification

### US-6: Password Recovery
1. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send reset link to registered email
2. WHEN a user clicks valid reset link THEN the system SHALL allow password change
3. WHEN a user sets new password THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing sessions
4. IF reset link is expired or invalid THEN the system SHALL display error and offer new reset
```

## Phase 2: Specification Writing (60 minutes)

### Step 4: Technical Specification Creation (30 minutes)

Create a comprehensive technical specification using the SDD template:

```markdown
# User Authentication System Specification

## Overview
Implementation of secure user authentication system with registration, login, session management, and password recovery functionality.

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with user and session tables
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
- **Email**: SendGrid for transactional emails
- **Security**: bcrypt for password hashing, rate limiting for brute force protection

### Security Considerations
- Password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds of 12
- JWT tokens with 1-hour expiration, refresh tokens with 30-day expiration
- Rate limiting: 5 login attempts per IP per 15 minutes
- Account lockout: 5 failed attempts per account per 15 minutes
- HTTPS required for all authentication endpoints
- Secure, httpOnly cookies for token storage
