# Advanced SDD Workflows

## Complex Integration Scenarios

This guide covers sophisticated Spec-Driven Development patterns for experienced teams working with legacy systems, microservices, and complex integration requirements.

## Legacy System Integration

### Modernization Strategy

When integrating SDD with existing codebases, follow this systematic approach:

#### Phase 1: Assessment and Mapping
1. **Audit Existing Code**: Document current architecture and dependencies
2. **Identify Integration Points**: Map where new specs will interface with legacy code
3. **Create Boundary Specs**: Write specifications for the interface between old and new systems
4. **Plan Migration Strategy**: Determine which components to modernize first

#### Phase 2: Incremental Specification
```markdown
# Legacy Integration Spec Template

## Current State Analysis
- Existing functionality: [describe current behavior]
- Technical debt: [identify problematic areas]
- Dependencies: [map external dependencies]
- Performance characteristics: [document current performance]

## Target State Specification
- New functionality: [specify desired behavior]
- Integration approach: [describe how new connects to old]
- Migration path: [outline transition strategy]
- Rollback plan: [define fallback approach]

## Implementation Strategy
- Phase 1: [minimal viable integration]
- Phase 2: [feature parity]
- Phase 3: [enhanced functionality]
- Phase 4: [legacy retirement]
```

### Strangler Fig Pattern with SDD

Implement the strangler fig pattern using structured specifications:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Legacy System] --> B[Facade Layer]
    B --> C[New SDD Component 1]
    B --> D[New SDD Component 2]
    B --> E[Legacy Component 3]
    C --> F[Spec-Driven Service]
    D --> G[Spec-Driven Service]
    E --> H[Legacy Service]
```

1. **Create Facade Specification**: Define the interface that will gradually replace legacy functionality
2. **Implement Component Specs**: Write detailed specs for each new component
3. **Define Migration Tasks**: Create specific tasks for moving functionality from legacy to new system
4. **Establish Testing Strategy**: Ensure both old and new systems work during transition

## Microservices Architecture

### Service Boundary Definition

Use SDD to clearly define microservice boundaries and contracts:

#### Service Specification Template
```markdown
# [Service Name] Specification

## Service Responsibility
- Primary function: [single responsibility]
- Data ownership: [what data this service owns]
- Business capability: [business function served]

## API Contract
- Endpoints: [REST/GraphQL/gRPC interfaces]
- Data models: [request/response schemas]
- Error handling: [error codes and messages]
- Versioning strategy: [how API versions are managed]

## Dependencies
- Upstream services: [services this depends on]
- Downstream consumers: [services that depend on this]
- External systems: [third-party integrations]
- Shared resources: [databases, message queues, etc.]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: [latency, throughput requirements]
- Availability: [uptime requirements]
- Scalability: [scaling characteristics]
- Security: [authentication, authorization, data protection]
```

### Cross-Service Workflow Specification

For workflows spanning multiple services, create orchestration specs:

```markdown
# Cross-Service Workflow: [Workflow Name]

## Workflow Overview
- Trigger: [what initiates this workflow]
- Participants: [services involved]
- Success criteria: [how to determine success]
- Failure handling: [error recovery strategy]

## Step-by-Step Flow
1. **Service A**: [action and expected outcome]
   - Input: [data required]
   - Output: [data produced]
   - Error conditions: [possible failures]

2. **Service B**: [action and expected outcome]
   - Input: [data from previous step]
   - Output: [data produced]
   - Error conditions: [possible failures]

## Compensation Logic
- Rollback strategy: [how to undo partial completion]
- Retry policies: [when and how to retry failed steps]
- Circuit breaker: [when to stop trying]
```

## Multi-Team Coordination

### Specification Handoff Process

When multiple teams work on related components:

#### Team A (API Provider) Responsibilities
1. **Define API Contract**: Create detailed API specification
2. **Mock Implementation**: Provide working mocks for dependent teams
3. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date API documentation
4. **Versioning**: Communicate breaking changes in advance

#### Team B (API Consumer) Responsibilities
1. **Integration Specification**: Define how they'll use the API
2. **Error Handling**: Specify how they'll handle API failures
3. **Testing Strategy**: Define integration testing approach
4. **Feedback Loop**: Provide usage feedback to API team

#### Coordination Specification Template
```markdown
# Cross-Team Integration: [Integration Name]

## Teams Involved
- Provider team: [team providing the service/API]
- Consumer teams: [teams using the service/API]
- Stakeholders: [product owners, architects, etc.]

## Interface Contract
- API specification: [link to detailed API spec]
- Data models: [shared data structures]
- Error handling: [error codes and recovery strategies]
- SLA commitments: [performance and availability guarantees]

## Development Coordination
- Timeline: [key milestones and dependencies]
- Communication plan: [how teams will coordinate]
- Testing strategy: [integration testing approach]
- Deployment coordination: [how releases will be managed]

## Change Management

```

## Event-Driven Architecture

### Event Specification Framework

For systems using event-driven patterns, create comprehensive event specifications:

```markdown
# Event Specification: [Event Name]

## Event Definition
- Event type: [domain event, integration event, etc.]
- Producer: [service that publishes this event]
- Consumers: [services that subscribe to this event]
- Business meaning: [what this event represents]

## Event Schema
```json
{
  "eventId": "string (UUID)",
  "eventType": "[event-name]",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "version": "semantic version",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific payload
  },
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "string",
    "causationId": "string",
    "source": "string"
  }
}
```
