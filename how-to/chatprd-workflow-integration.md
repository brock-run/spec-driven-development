# ChatPRD Workflow Integration Guide

## Overview

ChatPRD is an AI-powered tool designed to help product managers create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that seamlessly integrate with Spec-Driven Development workflows. This **setup guide** covers **workflow integration** and **collaboration** best practices for integrating ChatPRD with your SDD process.

## What is ChatPRD?

ChatPRD bridges the gap between product management and engineering by:
- Converting high-level product ideas into detailed, structured PRDs
- Generating AI-consumable requirements that work with SDD tools
- Facilitating cross-functional collaboration between PMs and engineering teams
- Maintaining living documentation that evolves with product development

## Setup and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- Product management background or training
- Access to ChatPRD platform (web-based or API)
- Understanding of your target development workflow (GitHub Spec Kit, Kiro, etc.)
- Stakeholder alignment on product vision and goals

### Initial Configuration

#### 1. Account Setup
```bash
# Access ChatPRD through web interface
# Visit: https://chatprd.ai (example URL)

# Or configure API access if available
export CHATPRD_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

#### 2. Project Initialization
1. Create new project in ChatPRD
2. Define product context and constraints
3. Set up integration preferences for your SDD toolchain
4. Configure collaboration settings for cross-functional teams

#### 3. Template Configuration
ChatPRD works best when configured with templates that match your SDD workflow:

**For GitHub Spec Kit Integration:**
- Configure output format to match Spec Kit's `/specify` requirements
- Set up user story templates with acceptance criteria
- Define technical constraint sections for `/plan` phase

**For Kiro IDE Integration:**
- Configure three-phase output (user stories, technical design, tasks)
- Set up requirement traceability formatting
- Define task breakdown granularity preferences

## ChatPRD Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Product Discovery and Requirements Gathering

#### Initial Product Brief
Start with a high-level product concept:

```
Product Concept: "Mobile expense tracking app for small business owners"

Key Questions to Address:
- Who is the target user?
- What problem are we solving?
- What are the core user journeys?
- What are the business objectives?
- What are the technical constraints?
```

#### Iterative Requirements Refinement
Use ChatPRD's conversational interface to drill down:

1. **User Personas and Journeys**
   ```
   Prompt: "Define the primary user persona for this expense tracking app. 
   Include their pain points, goals, and typical workflow."
   ```

2. **Feature Prioritization**
   ```
   Prompt: "List the core features needed for MVP, organized by user value 
   and implementation complexity."
   ```

3. **Success Metrics**
   ```
   Prompt: "Define measurable success criteria for each core feature, 
   including user engagement and business metrics."
   ```

### Phase 2: PRD Generation and Structuring

#### Comprehensive PRD Creation
ChatPRD generates structured PRDs with sections optimized for SDD:

**Standard PRD Structure:**
- Executive Summary
- Problem Statement
- User Personas and Journeys
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- Success Metrics
- Technical Considerations
- Implementation Phases

#### SDD-Optimized Output Format
Configure ChatPRD to generate requirements in formats compatible with your SDD tools:

**For Spec Kit `/specify` Phase:**
```markdown
## User Stories

### Core Expense Tracking
**As a** small business owner
**I want** to quickly capture expense receipts with my phone camera
**So that** I can maintain accurate financial records without manual data entry

#### Acceptance Criteria
- WHEN I take a photo of a receipt THEN the system SHALL extract vendor, amount, date, and category
- WHEN the OCR confidence is below 90% THEN the system SHALL prompt for manual verification
- WHEN an expense is saved THEN it SHALL be categorized according to IRS business expense categories
```

**For Kiro IDE Integration:**
```markdown
## Technical Design Requirements
- Receipt processing must handle images up to 10MB
- OCR processing should complete within 3 seconds
- Data must be stored locally with cloud sync capability
- Must support offline operation with sync when connected
```

### Phase 3: Cross-Functional Collaboration

#### Engineering Handoff Process
1. **PRD Review Session**
   - Schedule review with engineering leads
   - Walk through user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Clarify technical constraints and assumptions
   - Identify areas needing additional specification

2. **Technical Feasibility Assessment**
   - Engineering team reviews technical requirements
   - Identifies potential implementation challenges
   - Suggests alternative approaches if needed
   - Estimates complexity and timeline

3. **Specification Refinement**
   - Incorporate engineering feedback into PRD
   - Adjust scope based on technical constraints
   - Finalize acceptance criteria with engineering input
   - Create implementation priority order

## Integration Patterns

### ChatPRD → GitHub Spec Kit Workflow

#### Step 1: Generate PRD with ChatPRD
```
ChatPRD Input: "Create a PRD for a mobile expense tracking app targeting 
small business owners. Focus on receipt capture, categorization, and 
basic reporting features."
```

#### Step 2: Convert PRD to Spec Kit Format
```bash
# Initialize Spec Kit project
specify init expense-tracker

# Use ChatPRD output for /specify phase
/specify
# Paste refined user stories and requirements from ChatPRD
```

#### Step 3: Technical Planning
```bash
# Define technical architecture
/plan
# Include technical constraints identified during PRD review
```

#### Step 4: Implementation Planning
```bash
# Generate task breakdown
/tasks
# Ensure tasks trace back to ChatPRD requirements
```

### ChatPRD → Kiro IDE Workflow

#### Step 1: PRD Generation in ChatPRD
Generate comprehensive PRD with three-phase structure:
- User Stories with detailed acceptance criteria
- Technical design requirements
- Implementation task suggestions

#### Step 2: Import to Kiro
1. Create new spec in Kiro IDE
2. Import user stories from ChatPRD output
3. Refine technical design based on ChatPRD technical requirements
4. Generate implementation tasks with requirement traceability

#### Step 3: Iterative Refinement
Use Kiro's native SDD workflow to refine and implement:
- Validate user stories against ChatPRD success metrics
- Ensure technical design meets ChatPRD constraints
- Track implementation progress against original PRD
