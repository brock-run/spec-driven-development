# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

### Positive Behaviors
- **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
- **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
- **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- **Helping newcomers** learn SDD practices and contribute effectively
- **Sharing knowledge** and experience to benefit the community
- **Providing constructive code reviews** that help improve contributions

### Unacceptable Behaviors
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- **Dismissing contributions** based on contributor's experience level or background
- **Gatekeeping** or creating barriers for new contributors
- **Toxic technical debates** that prioritize being right over collaborative problem-solving
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Community-Specific Guidelines

### Technical Discussions
- **Focus on the contribution, not the contributor**: Critique ideas and code, not people
- **Assume good intentions**: Contributors are trying to help improve the project
- **Be patient with learning**: Everyone has different experience levels with SDD practices
- **Provide context**: Explain the "why" behind technical decisions and feedback

### Contribution Reviews
- **Be constructive**: Offer specific suggestions for improvement
- **Be timely**: Respond to contributions and reviews in a reasonable timeframe
- **Be thorough**: Take time to understand the contribution before reviewing
- **Be encouraging**: Recognize good work and effort, even if changes are needed

### Community Engagement
- **Welcome newcomers**: Help new contributors understand our processes and standards
- **Share knowledge**: Contribute to discussions and help answer questions
- **Respect diverse perspectives**: Different teams and organizations have different needs
- **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions focused on SDD practices and project goals

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting Process

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- **GitHub Issues**: For public violations that can be addressed transparently
- **Direct Contact**: Email project maintainers for sensitive issues
- **GitHub's Report Feature**: Use GitHub's built-in reporting for serious violations

### What to Include in Reports

When reporting violations, please include:

- **Description of the incident**: What happened and when
- **Individuals involved**: Who was involved (if comfortable sharing)
- **Evidence**: Links to comments, screenshots, or other documentation

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process
