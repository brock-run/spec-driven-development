# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to create a comprehensive, future-ready repository blueprint that serves as the definitive resource for Spec-Driven Development (SDD) in 2025. The repository will provide structured guidance, tools, templates, and training materials for teams adopting SDD methodologies with AI-assisted development. Drawing from the latest industry research and best practices from tools like GitHub Spec Kit and ChatPRD, this blueprint will serve multiple audiences from new developers to experienced practitioners, product managers, and team leads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer new to Spec-Driven Development, I want comprehensive getting-started resources and templates, so that I can quickly understand and begin implementing SDD practices in my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new developer accesses the repository THEN the system SHALL provide a clear README with quickstart links and overview
2. WHEN a developer needs templates THEN the system SHALL provide ready-to-use spec, plan, and task templates based on GitHub Spec Kit patterns
3. WHEN a developer follows the getting-started guide THEN the system SHALL walk them through their first complete SDD workflow
4. IF a developer is unfamiliar with SDD concepts THEN the system SHALL provide fundamental training materials explaining the difference between SDD, TDD, and vibe coding

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an experienced developer or team lead, I want advanced guidance and decision-making tools, so that I can effectively integrate SDD into existing workflows and make informed architectural decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an experienced practitioner needs guidance THEN the system SHALL provide decision trees for critical SDD routes (new projects, existing systems, AI agent selection)
2. WHEN integrating SDD with legacy systems THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance for modernization approaches
3. WHEN making architectural decisions THEN the system SHALL provide checklists for spec quality, acceptance criteria, and validation gates
4. IF scaling SDD across teams THEN the system SHALL provide governance and standards enforcement guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want SDD-specific guidance and integration with tools like ChatPRD, so that I can create detailed, AI-consumable product requirements that align with development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PM needs to write specs THEN the system SHALL provide PM-specific guidance for crafting detailed PRDs
2. WHEN integrating with ChatPRD THEN the system SHALL provide setup and workflow integration instructions
3. WHEN collaborating with engineering THEN the system SHALL provide templates for cross-functional handoff and alignment
4. IF managing product requirements THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on maintaining living documentation that stays synchronized with code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with AI agents, I want practical integration guides and troubleshooting resources, so that I can effectively use tools like GitHub Spec Kit, Copilot, and other AI coding assistants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up AI integration THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step setup guides for GitHub Spec Kit, ChatPRD, and major AI agents
2. WHEN using Model Context Protocol THEN the system SHALL provide MCP integration examples and best practices
3. WHEN troubleshooting AI outputs THEN the system SHALL provide debugging guides and refinement techniques
4. IF working with multiple AI agents THEN the system SHALL provide multi-agent compatibility guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a team member in a specific role (frontend, backend, QA, designer), I want role-specific SDD guidance, so that I can apply SDD practices effectively within my domain and collaborate seamlessly with other disciplines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a frontend developer needs guidance THEN the system SHALL provide frontend-specific SDD patterns and templates
2. WHEN a backend developer works with APIs THEN the system SHALL provide guidance connecting SDD to API-first development
3. WHEN QA needs to validate specs THEN the system SHALL provide test-spec synchronization guidance and quality gates
4. IF designers need to contribute to specs THEN the system SHALL provide design-to-spec workflow guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a team adopting SDD, I want structured training materials and real-world examples, so that we can learn from proven patterns and avoid common pitfalls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN teams need training THEN the system SHALL provide curriculum paths for different experience levels
2. WHEN learning hands-on THEN the system SHALL provide guided tutorials and sample projects
3. WHEN understanding real applications THEN the system SHALL provide case studies of successful and failed SDD implementations
4. IF validating learning THEN the system SHALL provide exercises and critique checklists for skill development

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a contributor to the SDD community, I want clear contribution guidelines and extensible structure, so that I can add templates, guides, and improvements that benefit the broader community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contributing content THEN the system SHALL provide clear CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines for specs, guides, and tools
2. WHEN adding new templates THEN the system SHALL provide a structured template directory with validation
3. WHEN submitting improvements THEN the system SHALL have CI workflows for validating markdown and running spec checks
4. IF extending the blueprint THEN the system SHALL maintain modular structure that supports future iterations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an organization evaluating SDD adoption, I want decision-making frameworks and implementation guidance, so that I can make informed choices about when and how to implement SDD practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating SDD adoption THEN the system SHALL provide decision trees for SDD vs. traditional approaches
2. WHEN planning implementation THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on hybrid workflows combining SDD with existing practices
3. WHEN assessing readiness THEN the system SHALL provide checklists for organizational and technical prerequisites
4. IF managing change THEN the system SHALL provide change management guidance for SDD adoption
