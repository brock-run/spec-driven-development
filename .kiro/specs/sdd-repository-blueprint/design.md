# Design Document

## Overview

The SDD Repository Blueprint will be implemented as a comprehensive, open-source repository that serves as the definitive resource for Spec-Driven Development adoption in 2025. The design follows a modular, audience-centric architecture that provides structured pathways for different user types while maintaining extensibility for future evolution. The repository will integrate seamlessly with modern AI development tools and provide both theoretical foundations and practical implementation guidance.

## Architecture

### Repository Structure

The repository follows a hierarchical, domain-driven structure that separates concerns while maintaining discoverability:

### Design Principles

1. **Audience-First Design**: Content is organized by user role and experience level rather than technical taxonomy
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is layered from basic concepts to advanced implementation details
3. **Tool Agnostic**: While featuring GitHub Spec Kit and ChatPRD, the blueprint supports multiple AI agents and tools
4. **Living Documentation**: All content is designed to evolve with the rapidly changing SDD landscape
5. **Community-Driven**: Extensible structure that encourages contributions and real-world validation

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Resource Components

#### Decision Trees (`resources/decision-trees/`)
Interactive Mermaid diagrams that guide users through critical decision points:
- **Project Initiation Tree**: SDD vs. traditional approaches, AI agent selection

### Training System

#### Curriculum Engine (`training/index.md`)
Adaptive learning paths based on role and experience:
- **Fundamentals Track**: Core concepts, spec writing, requirement refinement
- **Hands-On Track**: Guided tutorials, exercises, sample projects
- **Advanced Track**: AI critique, prompt refinement, troubleshooting

#### Assessment Framework
- **Knowledge Checks**: Conceptual understanding validation
- **Practical Exercises**: Hands-on spec creation and refinement
