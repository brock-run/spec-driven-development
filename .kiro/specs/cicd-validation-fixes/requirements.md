# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic resolution of CI/CD validation failures in the Spec-Driven Development Blueprint repository. The validation pipeline currently fails due to spelling errors, link validation tool compatibility issues, missing dependencies, and template structure inconsistencies. This feature will implement comprehensive fixes to ensure all validation checks pass consistently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Spell Check Resolution

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want all spelling issues resolved and the spell check dictionary updated, so that the CI/CD pipeline passes consistently and maintains high content quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the spell check runs THEN the system SHALL pass without any spelling errors
2. WHEN technical terms are used THEN the system SHALL include them in the .cspell.json dictionary
3. WHEN new technical terms are added THEN the system SHALL maintain alphabetical order in the dictionary
4. IF a term has multiple valid spellings THEN the system SHALL use the most common industry standard

### Requirement 2: Link Validation Tool Compatibility

**User Story:** As a CI/CD pipeline maintainer, I want the link validation to work with the current Node.js version, so that broken links are properly detected without tool compatibility errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN link validation runs THEN the system SHALL complete without Node.js compatibility errors
2. WHEN using Node.js 18 THEN the system SHALL use compatible versions of markdown-link-check
3. WHEN link validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about actual broken links
4. IF compatibility issues arise THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle version mismatches

### Requirement 3: Markdown Linting Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want markdown linting to work properly with all required dependencies, so that content formatting standards are consistently enforced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN markdown linting runs THEN the system SHALL have all required Node.js dependencies available
2. WHEN package.json is missing THEN the system SHALL create it with necessary dependencies
3. WHEN linting rules are applied THEN the system SHALL use consistent markdown standards
4. IF linting fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages

### Requirement 4: Template Structure Consistency

**User Story:** As a template user, I want all templates to have consistent structure and requirement references, so that they work reliably with AI agents and development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN templates are validated THEN the system SHALL ensure all templates have requirement references
2. WHEN backend/frontend/mobile templates are used THEN the system SHALL include "_Requirements:" sections
3. WHEN decision tree validation runs THEN the system SHALL handle Mermaid syntax properly
4. IF template structure is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance for fixes

### Requirement 5: CI/CD Pipeline Robustness

**User Story:** As a repository contributor, I want the CI/CD pipeline to be robust and provide clear feedback, so that I can quickly identify and fix validation issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable error messages
2. WHEN multiple validation steps run THEN the system SHALL continue processing even if one step fails
3. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate successful completion
4. IF validation tools have compatibility issues THEN the system SHALL use fallback approaches
