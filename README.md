# Spec-Driven Development Blueprint

A comprehensive, future-ready resource for adopting Spec-Driven Development (SDD) in 2025. This repository provides structured guidance, tools, templates, and training materials for teams leveraging AI-assisted development with modern tools like GitHub Spec Kit and ChatPRD.

## What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development is a methodology that emphasizes creating detailed, AI-consumable specifications before implementation. Unlike traditional "vibe coding" where developers jump straight into implementation, SDD provides a structured approach that:

- Creates clear, testable requirements and acceptance criteria
- Enables effective collaboration between AI agents and human developers
- Maintains living documentation that stays synchronized with code
- Reduces rework and improves code quality through upfront planning

## Who This Is For

This blueprint serves multiple audiences:

- **New Developers**: Get started with SDD fundamentals and your first spec
- **Experienced Developers**: Advanced planning techniques and legacy system integration
- **Product Managers**: PRD-to-spec translation and cross-functional collaboration
- **Team Leads**: Governance frameworks and change management for SDD adoption
- **Specialists**: Role-specific guidance for frontend, backend, QA, and design

## Quick Start

Choose your path based on your role and experience:

### New to SDD?
Start with the [Getting Started Guide](how-to/getting-started.md) to understand core concepts and create your first spec.

### Experienced Developer?
Jump to [Advanced Flows](how-to/advanced-flows.md) for legacy integration and multi-agent workflows.

### Product Manager?
Check out the [Product Manager Guide](audiences/product-managers.md) for ChatPRD integration and PRD translation.

### Team Lead?
Review the [Team Lead Guide](audiences/team-leads.md) for governance and adoption strategies.

## AI Tool Integration

This blueprint integrates with modern AI development tools:

- **GitHub Spec Kit**: Native support for /specify, /plan, /tasks, /implement commands
- **ChatPRD**: Product manager workflow integration
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Multi-agent coordination examples
- **Major AI Agents**: Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Kiro, and more

See [AI Integration Guide](how-to/ai-integration.md) for setup instructions.
