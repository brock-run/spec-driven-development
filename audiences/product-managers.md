# Product Manager Guide to Spec-Driven Development

## Bridging Product Vision and Technical Implementation

As a Product Manager, you're the bridge between business needs and technical execution. Spec-Driven Development transforms how you communicate requirements, ensuring your product vision translates accurately into working software while leveraging AI development tools effectively.

## PRD to Spec Translation

This section provides **PRD to spec** guidance for product managers working with engineering teams. Learn how to transform traditional product requirements into structured specifications that enable effective **cross-functional** collaboration.

### The Traditional PRD Challenge

Traditional Product Requirements Documents often suffer from:
- Ambiguous language that leads to misinterpretation
- Missing edge cases and error scenarios  
- Disconnect between business requirements and technical implementation
- Difficulty for AI agents to extract actionable development tasks

### The SDD Solution with ChatPRD Integration

SDD transforms your PRDs into structured, AI-consumable specifications that maintain product intent while providing technical clarity. **ChatPRD** integration streamlines this process by providing AI-assisted PRD-to-spec translation.

#### PRD-to-Spec Translation Framework

**Step 1: Business Requirements → User Stories**
```markdown
# Traditional PRD Statement
"Users should be able to manage their account settings efficiently"

# SDD User Story
**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to update my profile information and preferences, so that I can maintain accurate account details and customize my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I access account settings THEN I SHALL see all editable profile fields
2. WHEN I update my email THEN the system SHALL send a verification email
3. WHEN I save changes THEN the system SHALL confirm successful updates
4. IF I enter invalid data THEN the system SHALL show specific error messages
```

**Step 2: Feature Descriptions → Detailed Requirements**
```markdown
# Traditional PRD Feature
"Implement user notifications for important events"

# SDD Requirement Specification
### Requirement 3: Event Notification System
**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive timely notifications about important account events, so that I stay informed and can take necessary actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a security event occurs THEN the system SHALL send immediate notifications via email and in-app
2. WHEN I receive a notification THEN it SHALL include clear action items and relevant context
3. WHEN I click a notification THEN the system SHALL navigate me to the relevant page
4. IF I have disabled notifications THEN the system SHALL respect my preferences except for critical security events
5. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL log delivery status for audit purposes

#### Business Rules
- Critical notifications (security, billing) cannot be disabled
- Marketing notifications require explicit opt-in
- Notification frequency limits: max 3 non-critical per day
- All notifications must be accessible and WCAG 2.1 compliant
```

## ChatPRD Integration Workflow

### Setting Up ChatPRD for SDD

ChatPRD is designed to help PMs create structured, AI-consumable requirements. Here's how to integrate it with your SDD workflow:

#### Initial Setup
1. **Install ChatPRD**: Follow the setup guide for your preferred platform
2. **Configure Templates**: Use SDD-compatible templates for consistency
3. **Set Context**: Provide business domain and technical constraints
4. **Define Stakeholders**: Map roles to requirement validation responsibilities

#### ChatPRD SDD Workflow

**Phase 1: Requirement Generation**
```markdown
# ChatPRD Prompt Template
Context: [Product area, user segment, business goals]
Feature: [High-level feature description]
Constraints: [Technical, business, regulatory constraints]
Success Metrics: [How success will be measured]

Generate SDD-compatible requirements with:
- User stories in "As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit]" format
- EARS acceptance criteria (WHEN/IF/THEN structure)
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, accessibility)
```

**Phase 2: Requirement Refinement**
Use ChatPRD's iterative refinement to:
- Add missing edge cases identified through stakeholder review
- Clarify ambiguous acceptance criteria
- Ensure requirements are testable and measurable
- Validate business rule completeness

**Phase 3: Technical Handoff**
Export ChatPRD output to SDD format:
```markdown
# requirements.md (Generated from ChatPRD)
[ChatPRD structured output]

# Additional PM Context
## Business Priorities
1. User retention impact: High
2. Revenue impact: Medium  
3. Implementation urgency: Q1 delivery required

## Success Metrics
- User engagement: +15% feature adoption within 30 days
- Support tickets: -25% related to account management
- User satisfaction: >4.5/5 in post-feature survey
```
