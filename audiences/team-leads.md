# Team Lead Guide to SDD Governance and Implementation

## Leading the Transition to Spec-Driven Development

As a team lead, you're responsible for successfully implementing SDD practices while maintaining team productivity and morale. This guide provides **governance framework** and **change management** strategies for SDD adoption, along with **team training** approaches.

## Governance and Standards Framework

### SDD Governance Model

#### Three-Tier Governance Structure

**Tier 1: Team Standards**
- Code review requirements for SDD compliance
- Specification quality gates and checklists
- Definition of Done including specification completeness
- Team-specific SDD process adaptations

**Tier 2: Cross-Team Coordination**  
- Shared specification templates and standards
- Inter-team dependency management through specs
- Common tooling and AI agent configurations
- Knowledge sharing and best practice propagation

**Tier 3: Organizational Policy**
- SDD adoption mandates and timelines
- Resource allocation for SDD training and tooling
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Strategic alignment with business objectives

## Change Management for SDD Adoption

### Change Management Strategy

#### Stakeholder Analysis and Engagement
```markdown
# SDD Change Management Plan

## Stakeholder Mapping

### Champions (High Influence, High Support)
**Who:** Early adopters, senior developers, forward-thinking PMs
**Engagement Strategy:** Leverage as change agents and mentors
**Role:** Lead by example, provide peer support, share success stories

### Supporters (Low Influence, High Support)  
**Who:** Junior developers, new team members, process-oriented individuals
**Engagement Strategy:** Provide training and clear guidance
**Role:** Follow established processes, provide feedback on usability

### Skeptics (High Influence, Low Support)
**Who:** Senior developers comfortable with current processes
**Engagement Strategy:** Address concerns, demonstrate value, involve in design
**Role:** Critical feedback providers, eventual validators of approach

### Resisters (Low Influence, Low Support)
**Who:** Individuals resistant to process change
**Engagement Strategy:** Clear expectations, support, and accountability
**Role:** Compliance with minimum standards, gradual conversion
```

#### Communication Strategy
```markdown
# SDD Communication Plan

```

### Resistance Management

#### Common Resistance Patterns and Responses
```markdown
# Resistance Management Playbook

## "This slows us down" Resistance
**Root Cause:** Fear of reduced velocity in short term
**Response Strategy:**
- Show data on long-term velocity improvements
- Start with smaller features to demonstrate quick wins
- Pair experienced SDD practitioners with skeptics
- Measure and share rework reduction metrics

## "We already know what to build" Resistance  
**Root Cause:** Overconfidence in informal communication
**Response Strategy:**
- Document examples of miscommunication costs
- Show how SDD improves AI agent effectiveness
- Demonstrate cross-team collaboration improvements
- Use retrospectives to identify communication gaps

## "Too much process" Resistance
**Root Cause:** Process fatigue or bad experiences with heavy methodologies
**Response Strategy:**
- Emphasize lightweight, practical SDD implementation
- Show how SDD reduces other documentation overhead
- Customize process to team preferences and constraints
- Focus on value delivery rather than process compliance

## "AI will replace us anyway" Resistance
**Root Cause:** Fear of job displacement by AI agents
**Response Strategy:**
- Position SDD as AI collaboration, not replacement
- Show how SDD skills increase developer value and career prospects
- Demonstrate human creativity and judgment in specification creation
- Provide examples of AI augmenting rather than replacing developers
